# Iris

Toy webserver and a self-imposed code-golf project. Aims to replace instances of
`python.http` in my testing infrastructure, for easily serving a directory with
HTTP. Chances are _you_ don't need this.

Do not use in production, Iris has not been audited by a professional. If you
find a security vulnerability or a piece of code that affects speed or the
memory consumption of the program, feel free to create an issue on the issues
tab.

## Features

- Very low memory footprint
- Minimal dependencies (less than a rust 'Hello World' crate)
- Emphasis on security
- Fast
